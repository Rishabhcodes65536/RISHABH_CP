In 1st testcase:
Ninja is currently standing on building 1 with height 1m
If he can jump upto 2m.He would be able to perform following jumps
He would jump 1 m upwards from building 1 to building 2
1m upwards from building 2 to building 3
1m upwards from building 3 to building 4
2m from building 4 to building 5
He is jumping a maximum of 2 steps.It can be shown that 2 is the minimum amount of jumping power required to jump through all buildings

In 2nd testcases:
Ninja is currently standing on building 1 with height 50
He would jump 0m from building 1 to building 2
He would jump 0m from building 2 to building 3
So minimum jumping power of 0m would be required for ninja to get to last building
